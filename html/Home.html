		My name is Casey (Also spelled KC) and i really dont know what to put here. <br>I'm not the best with people or communication so I have learnt to use computers since I understand them more.<br>Feel free to look around this barebones website though! I spent a while getting it working due to minor bugs causing a butterfly effect but it works now! :)<br><i>I also really like purple if you can't tell by the color scheme.</i>
